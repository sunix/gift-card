### Step 1: Adding a Gift Card or Fidelity Card

2. **Click "Add Card"** to save the card
3. Your card will appear in the "My Gift Cards" section with:
   - **Automatic store recognition**: Cards from recognized stores (Decathlon, Super U, Leroy Merlin, Fnac, etc.) will display with custom branding and colors
   - **Card type badge**: Fidelity cards (without balance) show a purple "Fidelity Card" badge, while gift cards show their balance

### Step 2: Viewing and Organizing Your Cards
- All your cards are displayed in the "My Gift Cards" section
- **Store branding**: Recognized stores show their logo and custom colors automatically
- **Drag & Drop**: Click and drag cards to reorder them according to your preference
- **Card types**: 
  - Gift cards display their current balance in euros

### Step 3: Recording Transactions (Gift Cards Only)

4. **Click "Record Transaction"** to save
5. The card's balance updates automatically
6. View the **transaction history** below with dates, amounts, and remaining balances

**Note**: Fidelity cards don't have balance tracking, so transaction features are not available for them.

### Step 4: Managing Barcodes
Each card detail page displays a barcode generated from the card number:
- **Choose barcode format** from the dropdown menu
- Supported formats: CODE 128, CODE 39, EAN-13, EAN-8, UPC, ITF-14, MSI, Codabar
- The barcode updates immediately when you change the format
- The selected format is saved for each card

**Note:** The barcode is generated using the bwip-js library and implements standard barcode formats. You can use these barcodes for scanning at stores.

### Step 5: Archiving Cards
Keep your active card list organized by archiving cards you no longer use regularly:
1. Open the card detail modal
2. Click the **"Archive Card"** button
3. The card moves to the archived section
